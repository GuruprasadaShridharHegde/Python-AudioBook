The National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) was initiated by 
seven Indian Institutes of Technology (Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Guwahati and Roorkee)
along with the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2003. Five core disciplines were identified, 
namely, civil engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, electronics and 
communication engineering and mechanical engineering and 235 courses in web/video format were developed 
in this phase.
