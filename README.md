# Python-AudioBook
An audiobook (or a talking book) is a recording of a book or other work being read out loud.
### OVERVIEW
An audiobook (or a talking book) is a recording of a book or other work being read out loud. Audiobooks have traditionally been used with second-language learners, learning-disabled students, and struggling readers or nonreaders. In many cases, audiobooks have proven successful in helping these students to access literature and enjoy books.

In this pandemic everything has been changed. In student point of view almost everyone has an electronics gadget like smartphones and laptops but reading for a long time on gadgets leads to visual eye site problems. So, by the use of audiobook, we can reduce the stress on eye. The main advantages are quick learning, effective and very convenient also, like you can use it anywhere and finally you can save the time.

But the first thing is most of the audiobooks are not free, you have to pay extra money for that. Second thing is we may not get proper audiobook for our study in most of the cases like if we have some document’s and that only we need in the form of audiobook.

So, we came up with a solution by using Python programming knowledge. Our programming platform is PyCharm. By using these we can create our own audiobook at free of cost.

### Features of Main project code:
	Offline access

	Intake data from the user

	Male and female voice

	MP3 format document creation


### Features of Possible test case project code:
	GUI based user input for easy access.

	Multiple document support.

	Direct Access

### ALGORITHM

1.	Import required libraries: pyttsx3 & PyPdf2.
2.	Define audiobook parameters: Filename, read, count.
3.	Extract text & process: Speech speed rate, get single page according to loop.
4.	Voice configuration: Define genders, assign audio format.
5.	Getting data from the user: File location, page number, voice and saving file in MP3 format.

RESULT

Design and simulation of Audiobook using PyCharm is successfully done.

### CONCLUSION
•	We can see the usage of Audiobooks incrementing year by year globally because it can be used mainly in educational institutions and libraries.
•	We are planned to build and launch an android application to create Audiobook so that user can create their own Audiobooks independently.
